## Description:
In this two-player shooter game each player is controlling a tank and has to take down the enemy while avoiding the approaching missiles. Each tank can be destroyed by being hit twice and the last man standing is the winner. 
To start the game both players have to keep the joystick button pressed for one second, triggering a 3 seconds countdown which will allow them to get ready. After only one tank will remain in the battle, an arrow will appear to indicate the winner and the players can start a new match by pressing the joystick buttons again.
More details about the game progress can be seen at any time on the LCD.
